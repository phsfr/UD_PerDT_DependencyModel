# UDPipe 2

UDPipe 2 is a Python prototype, capable of performing tagging, lemmatization and
syntactic analysis of CoNLL-U input. It took part in several competitions,
reaching excellent results in all of them:
- one of the winners of the [CoNLL 2018 Shared Task](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K18-2001/)
- one of the winners of the [SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task 2](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4226/)
- the winner of [EvaLatin 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lt4hala-1.16/)

Compared to UDPipe 1, it is Python-only, it does not perform tokenization, and
the models require more computation power.

## Webservice

The UDPipe 2 models are currently available from the
[LINDAT UDPipe REST Service](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/).
Apart from the web interface, you can use the following Python
client script to process your files. TODO

## Models

The available models are described [on a separate page](/udpipe/2/models).
